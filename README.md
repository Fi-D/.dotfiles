# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .vimrc
This is my custom .vimrc configuration for Vim.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.


#There are 2 directories in the folder. Inside the etc folder, you will find a bashrc_custom filethat contains all of the alias that will help you in your future. Likewise, the vimrc file includes the configurations for vim so that you won't have to change the setting each time you open vim. Inside the bin folder will contain 2 scripts to make this work. The linux.sh script contains all the command to check and run if and only if your OS matches with linux OS. The cleanup.sh script is there to reverse everything that was done in the linux.sh script. In the main directory is a Makefile. This will tell the terminal to run the required script to make this work after entering "make" in the terminal.
